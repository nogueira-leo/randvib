  abstract = {Composite materials along with isotropic materials possess abundant applications to various engineering disciplines like aerospace and mechanical issues. The design optimization of composite materials such as sandwich panels essentially needs an accurate vibro-acoustic modeling. Such a modeling of these materials and a sound synthesis can lead to a design approach based on relevant psychoacoustic analyses. In this research, the mathematical/numerical and experimental steps required by the vibro-acoustic modeling of composite and isotropic plates excited by a diffuse acoustic field (DAF) are discussed. Herein, the analytical modeling was performed by 4th and 6th order problems adapted for the composite and isotropic plates, and moreover, the numerical modeling was carried out via the Finite Element Method (FEM). The experimental observations were also performed by means of an acoustic test cabin used for ideally generating a diffuse acoustic field (DAF). The various types of analytical and numerical simulations including synthesized sounds required by future psycho-acoustic analyses, as well as experimental observations including recorded sounds were investigated and compared. Finally, based on the various analyses, the research illustrates how such investigations and comparisons are necessary for designing and enhancing the mechanical and vibro-acoustic properties of materials.},

  abstract = {The response of a structure to turbulent boundary layer (TBL) excitation has been an area of research for roughly 50 years, although uncertainties persist surrounding the low-wavenumber levels of the TBL surface pressure spectrum. In this experimental investigation, a cylindrical shell with a smooth internal surface is subjected to TBL excitation from water in fully developed pipe flow. The cylinder’s vibration response to this excitation is used to determine low-wavenumber TBL surface pressure levels at lower streamwise wavenumbers than previously reported (k1/kco 0.01). An experimental modal analysis is also conducted on the water-filled cylindrical shell to determine structural parameters which are used to extract TBL pressures. The measured low-wavenumber pressure data falls midway between TBL models by Smol’yakov [Acoustical Physics 52(3) (2006) 331–337] and Chase [Journal of Sound and Vibration 112(1) (1987) 125–147] and is roughly 23 dB lower than an early TBL model by Corcos [Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 35(2) (1963) 192–198]. The current data is a few decibels below the lower bound of related measurements in air by Farabee and Geib [ICIASF ‘75 Record, 1975, pp. 311–319] and Martin and Leehey [Journal of Sound and Vibration 52(1) (1977) 95–120]. A simple wavenumber white form for the TBL surface pressure spectrum at low-wavenumber is suggested.},

  abstract = {A turbulent boundary layer (TBL) can be an important source of noise and vibration and its simulation is still an open research challenge. The stochastic pressure distribution associated with turbulence can significantly excite a structure that radiates acoustic power. In such a situation, a good description of the wall pressure field is necessary for an accurate prediction of the vibration and noise propagation. In order to tackle this issue, many TBL models have been developed since the 50s. Among others, the Corcos model has been widely used, especially because of its advantageous mathematical features. However, a major drawback is the small rate of decay for wavenumbers below the coincidence frequency.},

  abstract = {An important problem in the transmission of the sound is the noise due to the pressure fluctuations of a turbulent boundary layer (TBL). The action of the stochastic pressure distribution associated with the turbulence provides the driving force to excite the underlying structure, generating vibration and noise, and therefore, producing acoustic radiation into a back cavity enclosed by the boundary surface. In the following paper, the flow-induced noise in a cavity-plate system is analysed by using a Generalized Corcos model, recently developed by the authors. Analytical method is used to predict the noise transmitted into a rectangular cavity by a flexible plate driven on one side by a stationary TBL. The plate acceleration power spectral density and the interior sound pressure level are provided without the need for computationally costly numerical integration. Results show how the different decay rates of the Generalized Corcos model at low-wavenumber affect the predictions and allow positioning the novel model with respect to other well-established models.},

  abstract = {Plate vibrations due to turbulent boundary layer (TBL) excitation can depend strongly on the plate boundary conditions, especially when the flow convects over the plate at speeds much slower than those of the bendingwaves in the plate. The vibration response of a TBL excited baffled flat rectangular plate is analyzed with two sets of boundary conditions: (a) all four edges clamped, and (b) three edges clamped and one edge free, with the flow direction perpendicular to the free edge. A finite element model with discretization sufficient to resolve the convective wavenumbers in the flow excitation field is used for the study. Three TBL wall pressure excitation models are applied to the plates to represent the cross-spectra of the wall pressures: (i) a modified Corcos model, which includes all wavenumber components of excitation; (ii) a low-wavenumber excitation model previously derived by one of the authors, which only models the wavenumber-white region of the modified Corcos model; and (iii) an equivalent edge force model which only models the convective component in the modified Corcos model. The TBL wall pressure autospectrum is approximated usingthe model derived by Smolyakov and Tkachenko. The results obtained from applying models (ii) and (iii) to the clamped and free edge plates are compared to those generated using model (i). For the completely clamped boundary conditions, the low-wavenumber and Modified Corcos models yield nearly identical vibration spectra, indicatingthat surface interactions dominate the response of fully clamped plates excited by TBL pressures. For the free edge boundary condition, the vibrations predicted using the equivalent edge force and modified Corcos models match very well, showingthat edge interactions between TBL pressures and structural modes dominate the vibrations of plates with free edges excited by TBL flow. r 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {This paper aims at developing an experimental method to characterize the vibroacoustic response of a panel to a diffuse acoustic field (DAF) excitation with a different laboratory setup than those used in standards (i.e., coupled rooms). The proposed methodology is based on a theoretical model of the DAF and on the measurement of the panel's sensitivity functions, which characterize its vibroacoustic response to wall plane waves. These functions can be estimated experimentally using variations of the reciprocity principle, which are described in the present paper. These principles can either be applied for characterizing the structural response by exciting the panel with a normal force at the point of interest or for characterizing the acoustic response (radiated pressure, acoustic intensity) by exciting the panel with a monopole and a dipole source. For both applications, the validity of the proposed approach is numerically and experimentally verified on a test case composed of a baffled simply supported plate. An implementation for estimating the sound transmission loss of the plate is finally proposed. The results are discussed and compared with measurements performed in a coupled anechoic-reverberant room facility following standards.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the modelling of a vibrating structure excited by a turbulent boundary 15 layer (TBL). Although the wall pressure field (WPF) of the TBL constitutes a random excitation, the element-based methods generally used for describing complex mechanical structures consider deterministic loads. The response of such structures to a random excitation like TBL is generally deduced from calculations of numerous Frequency Response Functions. Consequently, the process is computationally expansive. To tackle this issue, an efficient 20 process is proposed for generating realizations of the WPF corresponding to the TBL. This process is based on a formulation of the problem in the wave-number space and the interpretation of the wall pressure field as uncorrelated wall plane waves. Once the WPF has been synthesized, the local vibroacoustic responses are calculated for the different realizations and averaged together in the last step. A numerical application of this process to a plate located 25 beneath a TBL is used to verify its efficiency and ability to reproduce the partial space correlation of the excitation. To further illustrate the proposed method, a stiffened panel modelled using the finite element method is finally examined.},

  abstract = {A diffuse sound field is conventionally defined as a zero-mean circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random field. A more recent, generalized definition is that of a sound field having mode shapes that are diffuse in the conventional sense, and eigenfrequencies that conform to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. Such a generalized diffuse sound field can represent a random ensemble of sound fields that share gross features, such as modal density and total absorption, but otherwise have any possible arrangement of local wave scattering features. The problem of generating realizations or Monte Carlo samples of a conventional diffuse sound field or, equivalently, of the mode shapes of a generalized diffuse sound field, is addressed here. Such realizations can be obtained from an eigenvalue decomposition of the spatial correlation function. A discrete decomposition is numerically expensive when the sound pressures at many locations are of interest, so a fast analytical decomposition based on prolate spheroidal wave functions is developed. The approach is numerically validated by comparison with a detailed room model, where random wave scatterers are explicitly modeled as acoustic point masses with random positions, and good correspondence is observed. Furthermore, applications involving correlated sound sources and sound-structure interaction are presented.},
